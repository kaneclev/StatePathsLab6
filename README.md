# StatePathsLab6

This lab was completed during Fall '22 for CS256 (Data Structures).
The goal of this lab was pathfinding between states in order to find travelable paths from one state to another, and be able
to print out the contents of the path.
It does this by using two files that are loaded in UnitedStates.java which contain a file of states and another with their corresponding codes.
These files are contiguous-use.txt and codes.csv.

Uses simple data structures like arraylists to complete the task. 

PrintState() will list all of the neighboring states for each state in the US.
