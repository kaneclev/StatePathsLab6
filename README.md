# StatePathsLab6

This lab was completed during Fall '22 for CS256 (Data Structures).
The goal of this lab was pathfinding between states in order to find travelable paths from one state to another, and be able
to print out the contents of the path.

Uses simple data structures like arraylists to complete the task.
